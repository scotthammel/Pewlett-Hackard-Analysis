### Summary:

-  Prepare for the future: the "silver tsunami" will leave close to 90,400 positions vacant. Based on the employees.csv, there are a total of 300,024 emloyees working for Pewlett Hackard. 
   * Out of around 90,400 employees eligible to retire, which account for nearly 30% of the total workforce. 
   * There are not enough qualified (1,549), retirement-ready employees to menor the next generation.
- I recommend adusting the elibility year (1965), so there is more mentors able to help with the next generation of employees.


- Other: Promote staff earlier into management roles to balance out the data.
